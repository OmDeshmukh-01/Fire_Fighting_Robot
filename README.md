Title : Arduino Uno-based autonomous fire-fighting robot that detects and extinguishes fire.

Proposed Solution: 
"Designing a robot that autonomously detects and extinguishes fires Without Human Intervention."

How it addresses the Problem:
This robot is designed for early intervention, capable of navigating toward a fire and extinguishing it quickly, reducing the risk of significant damage.
By offering a mobile-controlled interface, it allows human intervention from a safe distance, while the camera feed provides visual feedback for precise control.
Furthermore, the autonomous detection feature ensures that it can act independently without requiring continuous human supervision.
